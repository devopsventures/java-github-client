name: Build and Test - Docker

#
# This workflow uses the offical Docker Hub maven image to provide a version of Maven and Java JDK for use in 
# building the project.
#
# The maven execution injects Artifactory configuration details via the settings.xml file that is provided
# as part of the sources. These are stored as Secrets and can be provided at a Repository or Organization level.
